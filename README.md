# Responsive E-Commerce Website for a Fashion Store  

## 📖 Project Overview  
This project is a **responsive e-commerce fashion store website** developed as part of the **Software Development I (CSE 2216)** course. The main objective was to design and implement a front-end web application that simulates an online fashion store.  

The website provides an intuitive shopping experience with features such as:  
- Responsive layout for cross-device compatibility  
- Product categorization (Men & Women collections)  
- Image slider for promotional content  
- Product grid with hover effects  
- Comprehensive footer with multiple navigation options  

While the project focuses on **front-end only**, it lays the groundwork for a fully functional e-commerce platform.
